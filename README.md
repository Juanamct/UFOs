# UFO Sightings Webpage with  Project Analysis

## Overview of the Project: 
###   Building a dynamic webpage that will allow visitors to Dana's webpage to use multiple custom filters of the UFO sightings data to return the data in which the visitor is interested.  
###   This  project will be created using JavaScript and HTML, by modifying the code in the index.html file to create filters for the city, state, country, and shape, in addition to the date field as shown in the following image.

  #### 1) I will build input boxes that will adjust accordingly
  #### 2) By inserting JavaScript into an HTML page
  #### 3) 

## Results:
  ### 1) To perform a query/search:
   #### a. Type into one or more of the filter boxes the data you wish to see
   #### b. The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".  
   #### c. Each filter box has examples of the form in which the data is structured for input.  For example, all text is in lower case, date is in the form of 1/11/1111. 


## Drawback and Recommendations:
  ### 1) Drawback of current page: with such a long list of data it is not clear what the full range of data is in each field to choose.  For example, what is the date range available to query.
  ### 2) Recommend changing input boxes to drop down boxes for clear view of    data options.
  ### 3) Recommend creating a clickable "clear filters" input
